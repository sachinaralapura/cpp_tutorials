/*Arrays can be initialized when you define them.
A list containing the values for the individual array elements is used to initialize the array:

=> If the array length is explicitly stated in the definition and is larger than the number of initial values,
any remaining array elements are set to zero.

=> If, in contrast, the number of initial values exceeds the array length, the surplus values are ignored.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>Locally defined arrays are created on the stack at program runtime. You should there-
fore be aware of the following issues when defining arrays:

    ðŸ‘‰ Arrays that occupy a large amount of memory (e.g., more than one kbyte) should be defined as global or static.
    ðŸ‘‰ Unless they are initialized, the elements of a local array will not necessarily have
       a definite value. Values are normally assigned by means of a loop 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You cannot assign a vector to another vector. However, you can overload the assign-
ment operator within a class designed to represent arrays.
